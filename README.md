# Final Project

Each team member choose 1 front end feature and 1 back end feature to add. An example could be adding a list of all conversations and being able to switch to them, add feature to display usernames on the chat ui, add back end endpoint to reload a user session when user refreshes page. Be creative.

Please implement a full endpoint for the back end, and a full standalone feature on the front end. Each person's score will be separate and graded accordingly. Shared 10% of score is from live demo.
